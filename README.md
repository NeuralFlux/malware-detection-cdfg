### Control Flow Graph Based Multiclass Malware Detection Using Bi-normal Separation ([paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Control-Flow-Graph-Based-Multiclass-Malware-Using-Kapoor-Dhavale/948086e011c896c44d7594aba06c0f30d217c916?sort=is-influential))

Based on ([this](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Control-flow-based-opcode-behavior-analysis-for-Ding-Dai/b9b014bdfdf3ea82c90a32d4d5bc62f3c5d3ba17) paper)
The paper proposes a method that involves
 - check if the test executable is packed (using PEiD software)
 - if so, unpack the executable using a suitable unpacker
 - generate a graph where the nodes represent a "basic" block of instructions
 - a basic block is defined to have only one entry and exit point, i.e., there is no change of control in midst of them
 - edges represent flow of control
 - all possible paths starting from the root are traversed to get an extensive signature of the executable
